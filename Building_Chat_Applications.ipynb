    "This Python script demonstrates how to build a simple, interactive chatbot using the Azure AI Inference SDK. It's designed to be a clear and well-documented example, perfect for a GitHub repository. The core functionality revolves around managing a conversation's history by continuously updating a list of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of the Code\n",
    "# 1. Setup and Initialization\n",
    "import statements: The script begins by importing necessary classes from the azure-ai-inference package and other standard libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatCompletionsClient: The main class for interacting with Azure's chat completion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "SystemMessage, UserMessage, AssistantMessage: These classes represent the different roles in a conversation (system, user, and the AI assistant).\n",
    "\n",
    "AzureKeyCredential: A class to securely handle your API key for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "os and dotenv: Used for loading environment variables, which is the best practice for keeping sensitive information like API keys out of your source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading Environment Variables: The load_dotenv() function reads key-value pairs from a .env file in the same directory. This prevents hardcoding secrets. The script then retrieves the Azure endpoint, API key, and model name from these variables. An if statement checks that all variables were successfully loaded, exiting with an error message if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client Initialization: The ChatCompletionsClient is instantiated. This object acts as the interface to the Azure AI service. You provide it with the endpoint URL, the credential (your API key), and the api_version to ensure compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Conversation Management\n",
    "messages list: A list named messages is created to store the entire conversation history. It is initialized with a SystemMessage. This message sets the \"persona\" or overall behavior of the AI for the entire chat session (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant.\"). This is a crucial step for guiding the model's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive Loop (while True): The script enters an infinite loop, allowing the user to have a continuous conversation with the bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. The Chatbot's Logic\n",
    "User Input: The line user_input = input(\"You: \") prompts the user for their message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exit Condition: An if statement checks if the user typed 'quit'. If so, the loop breaks, and the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appending User Message: The user's input is packaged into a UserMessage object, which is then appended to the messages list. This adds the user's latest query to the conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Call: client.complete(messages=messages, ...) sends the entire messages list to the Azure AI model. The model receives all previous turns of the conversation (system message, user messages, and assistant responses) and uses this context to generate a new, relevant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing and Printing Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "response.choices[0].message.content: The model's response is a complex object. This line accesses the first (and in this case, only) completion choice and extracts the actual text content of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The print statement displays the assistant's response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appending Assistant Message: Just as with the user's message, the assistant's response is converted into an AssistantMessage object and appended to the messages list. This is the most important step for maintaining context. By adding the AI's response to the history, the next time the loop runs, the model will remember what it just said.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of adding both user and assistant messages to the messages list, and then sending the complete list with each new request, is the fundamental principle of building a stateful, multi-turn chatbot."

      "Hmm... \"tell me about stars\" is open-ended. Should I focus on science? Mythology? Practical stargazing? Given no context, science feels safestâ€”it's core knowledge.

      "\n",
      "### Key Facts About Stars:\n",
      "1. **Formation**:  \n",
      "   - Born in **nebulas** (giant clouds of gas and dust).  \n",
      "   - Gravity pulls material into a dense core â†’ heats up â†’ triggers **nuclear fusion** (hydrogen â†’ helium).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Energy Source**:  \n",
      "   - Powered by fusion in their cores, releasing immense energy as light, heat, and radiation.  \n",
      "   - Our Sun fuses 600 million tons of hydrogen per second!  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lifecycle**:  \n",
      "   - **Mass determines fate**:  \n",
      "     - **Small stars** (e.g., red dwarfs): Burn slowly, live trillions of years.  \n",
      "     - **Medium stars** (like the Sun): Become red giants â†’ shed outer layers â†’ leave behind **white dwarfs**.  \n",
      "     - **Massive stars**: Explode as **supernovae**, forming **neutron stars** or **black holes**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Characteristics**:  \n",
      "   - **Color & Temperature**:  \n",
      "     - Blue (hottest: 30,000+Â°C) â†’ White â†’ Yellow (Sun: 5,500Â°C) â†’ Orange â†’ Red (coolest: ~3,000Â°C).  \n",
      "   - **Brightness**: Depends on size, temperature, and distance.  \n",
      "   - **Size Range**:  \n",
      "     - Neutron stars: ~20 km wide!  \n",
      "     - Supergiants (e.g., Betelgeuse): 1,000x wider than the Sun.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Variety**:  \n",
      "   - **Binary/Multiple Systems**: 2+ stars orbiting each other.  \n",
      "   - **Variable Stars**: Brightness changes over time.  \n",
      "   - **Pulsars**: Rapidly spinning neutron stars emitting radio waves.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Importance**:  \n",
      "   - Create heavy elements (carbon, oxygen, iron) via fusion/supernovae.  \n",
      "   - Their planets may host life (like Earth!).  \n",
      "   - Used for navigation, calendars, and cultural stories throughout history.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Fun Fact:  \n",
      "The closest star to Earth is the **Sun** (150 million km away). The next nearest, **Proxima Centauri**, is 4.24 *light-years* distantâ€”about 40 trillion km!  \n",
      "\n",
